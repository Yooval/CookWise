## Overview

**CookWise** is a web application that allows users to create and manage their own recipes. Users can register, log in, upload images, and build a personalized collection of recipes. It provides a secure and organized platform for users to store and manage their own culinary quest.


## Tech & Tools:  
Hereâ€™s the updated **Tech & Tools** section with the "Tests" part revised for better readability and flow:

---

## Tech & Tools:  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF):** Used to create secure and reliable APIs. It makes handling things like authentication and data serialization much easier.  
- **Testing:**  
   - **Unit Tests:** Ensure that individual parts of the app, like user registration or recipe creation, work correctly on their own.  
   - **Integration Tests:** Check that different features of the app, like logging in and uploading images, work well together.  
   - **Test-Driven Development:** Writing tests before the code ensures everything works as expected and helps catch bugs early.  
- **Docker:** Used to create a consistent environment for building, testing, and running the app, so it works the same everywhere.  
- **AWS:** The app is hosted on AWS, which helps keep it reliable, fast, and accessible to users at any time.

# Deployment

Local Deployment (Ensure Port is Set to 8000)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-deploy.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose-deploy.yml up
```

# Connecting to an EC2 Instance

1. Set up SSH keys.
2. Add the SSH key-pair into the EC2 instance.
3. Connect to the EC2 instance using the following command:

```bash
ssh ec2-user@IPADRESSHERE
```

4. Create ssh key-pair in EC2 instance

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -b 4096
